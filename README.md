# clash-for-win-self-rules-appender
automatically append self-defined rules to a remote subscription, a workaroud for [#593](https://github.com/Fndroid/clash_for_windows_pkg/issues/593)

# Dependencies
pyyaml, watchdog

# How to use
1. Modify the file `myconf.yml` in the repo cloned on your disk to **add customized rules**
2. Duplicate your CFW (clash for windows) config by clicking "Duplicate Profile" button on your subscribed profile in the "Profiles" tab of Clash For Windows

3. Click "Edit in text mode" button on the profile you just cloned and open it with your favorite text editor just to get its path. Of course you can directly go to `%userprofile%\.config\clash` to identify your customized profile by the created date or modified date

4. Run `python main.py --config <path to your customized profile>`
5. Click "Update this profile" on your subscribed profile, and your customized profile will be updated at the same time
6. Click and select your customized profile to make it effective

# Customized Rule Format
Here's an example: (in `myconf.yml`)
```yml
Rule:
  - DOMAIN,i.imgur.com,Proxy
  - DOMAIN-SUFFIX,live.net,Proxy
  - DOMAIN-KEYWORD,kaggle,Proxy
```
Basically you just need to keep the format `  - [type],[content],[policy]` for each item you want to append

 * type: can be one of `DOMAIN-SUFFIX, DOMAIN, DOMAIN-KEYWORD, IP-CIDR, SRC-IP-CIDR, GEOIP, DST-PORT, SRC-PORT, MATCH`
 * content: like `d.doc.live.net`
 * policy: `DIRECT, Proxy, no-resolve`

You may noticed that they're just the same as those when you try to add new Rule for your CFW profile

> Just beaware that the more rules you add, the more system resource CFW will take
